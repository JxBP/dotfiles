My river config attempts to start sandbar which is a dwm-like bar.
There is a git submodule to easily install sandbar. You only need to execute
the following command to download it:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

After that go into ./sandbar (from this README's directory out) and compile and
install sandbar using 'make install'.
